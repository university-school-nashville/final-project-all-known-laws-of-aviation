I will be making a text-based adventure RPG. 
The main challenges will be making the computer understand english and writing the actual story.
I will use a battle system that is turn based and damage will be calculated by weapon type and armor type
speed will be calculated with a coin flip or an item that the player can get
There will be a map with many rooms 
It will mainly focus on puzzles using a magic SNES contoller and video game references
